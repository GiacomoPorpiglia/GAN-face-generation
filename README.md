# Face Generation with GAN

In this project I have implemented a Generative Adversarial Network for face generation, using WGAN-GP loss.
The network was trained on the CASIA-webface dataset, containing approximately 500k images of human faces.</br>
The model can generate 128x128 pixels images. Here are some results after training:
